# disable-aa

Disable anti-aliasing globally in Atom. I don't know about anyone else, but I like reading things this
way.

When this package is enabled, anti-aliasing is disabled globally. If anyone cares, I may tweak it
so that it's only disabled in the editor and possibly in the file browser if desired.
